Chapter 1. Linux Filesystem Hierarchy
-------------------------------------
1.1  Foreward

1. Most UNIX filesystem types have a similar general structure, although the exact details vary quite a bit. The
central concepts are superblock,inode,data block,directory block, and indirection block.
The superblock contains information about the filesystem as a whole, such as its size (the exact information here depends on
the filesystem). 
An inode contains all information about a file, except its name. 
The name is stored in the directory, together with the number of the inode. A directory entry consists of a filename 
and the number of the inode which represents the file. The inode contains the numbers of several data blocks, which are used to
store the data in the file. There is space only for a few data block numbers in the inode, however, 
and if more are needed, more space for pointers to the data blocks is allocated dynamically. These dynamically allocated
blocks are indirect blocks; the name indicates that in order to find the data block, one has to find its number in
the indirect block first.

2. /usr/share/doc/[program−name] -> Programs documentation file 
3. /usr/share/man/man[1−9] ->man(ual) pages 
4./usr/share/info -> info pages

5."Shareable" files are defined as those that can be stored on one host and
 used on others.
6 ."Unshareable" files are those that are not shareable. 
   For example, the files in user home directories are shareable whereas device lock files are not. 

7."Static" files include binaries, libraries,documentation files and other files that do not change without system administrator intervention. 
8. "Variable"  are not static file .
9. ctrl−alt−del -> a shortcut to properly shutdown the  linux system to keep all the file safe.
10. there was no clear distinction between /bin and /usr/bin
