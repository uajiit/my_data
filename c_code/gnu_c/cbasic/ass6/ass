2. Strrev – string reverse

3. Strcat – string concatenation

4. Strcmp – string comparison

5. Strlwr – string lower

6. Strupr – string upper

7. Strcpy – string copy

eg., Input :56 (Should be taken using scanf %d)
Output : 56 (Should be printed using %s)

* [ ] 11)WAP to convert a string to integer type(Own implementation of atoi function)
eg., Input: 47 (Should be taken using scanf %s)
Output :100: 47 (Should be printed using %d).
